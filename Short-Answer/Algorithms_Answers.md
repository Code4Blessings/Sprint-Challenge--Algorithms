#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Answer: 0(n^3)

- The time complexity is 0(n^3) because on line 10 you have n^3.  On line 11 you have n^2.  The actual result is O(n^3 + n^2).  If you were to simplify this, the final result would be 0(n^3) because when you put n^3 and n^2 together, the worst case would always be 0(n^3).


b) Answer: 0(n)

- In this problem you have 4 operations and 2 constants.  This gives you a time complexity of 0(4n + 2).  Simplified, this would be 0(n).


c) Answer: 0(n)

- Like 26 & 27 are both constants.  However line 28 bunnyEars increase with the amount of bunnies which is n.  This leads to 0(2 + n), smplified, 0(n)
